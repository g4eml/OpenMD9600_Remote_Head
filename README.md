# OpenMD9600_Remote_Head

The MD9600 is a good DMR mobile radio but, as standard, it does not have the ability to mount the control head remotely to the main body of the radio. 

The Control Head of the radio is normally connected to the front panel by a 30 conductor Flat Flexible cable. It is impractical to try to extend this cable. 

Now that the radio is able to run the excellent OpenMD9600 firmware it became possible to develop a way of communicating between the radio and the front panel using only a single RJ45 Cat7 cable. This requires a modified version of the OpenMD9600 firmware.
